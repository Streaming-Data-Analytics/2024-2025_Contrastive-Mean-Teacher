# 2024-2025 Contrastive Mean Teacher for Domain Adaptive Object Detectors

Optional project of the [Streaming Data Analytics](http://emanueledellavalle.org/teaching/streaming-data-analytics-2023-24/) course provided by [Politecnico di Milano](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=811164&polij_device_category=DESKTOP&__pj0=0&__pj1=d563c55e73c3035baf5b0bab2dda086b).

Student: Paolo Bettanin

## Background
Domain Adaptation for Object Detection addresses the challenge of deploying models trained on a labeled source domain (e.g., synthetic data) to an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world data), where distribution shifts impair performance.

The paper Contrastive Mean Teacher for Domain Adaptive Object Detectors (CVPR 2023) introduces a novel approach combining Mean Teacher models with contrastive learning for domain adaptive object detection. The method leverages consistency training and contrastive objectives to align features and predictions across domains, resulting in state-of-the-art performance.

This project involves studying the paper in depth and reproducing the official code from its GitHub repository. The goal is to understand the key components, training pipeline, and results of the proposed approach.

## Goals and objectives
- Study the methodology proposed in the "Contrastive Mean Teacher" paper.
- Reproduce the experiments using the official code.
- Understand the training pipeline, loss components, and architecture details.
- Analyze the reported results and compare them with the reproduced outcomes.
- Present the models used, training configurations, and domain pairs.
- Provide a detailed summary of the paperâ€™s contributions and results.
- Reflect on potential improvements, limitations, or extensions of the approach.

## Deliverable
At the end of the project, the student should deliver:
- A well-organized set of notebooks or scripts that:
  - Reproduce the official code and training pipeline.
  - Provide visual and quantitative comparisons with the original results.
  - Explain each component of the architecture and training process.

- A written report or presentation including:
  - A structured summary of the paper.
  - Insights on model performance, limitations, and potential enhancements.

This project will help students gain practical experience in understanding state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques for object detection and familiarize them with reproducibility challenges in deep learning research.
